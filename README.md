# Udata
A react app which fetches user data on click which shows loading while fetching data. 
# Method
I used bootsrtap navbar and card components to create navbar and card. I created a function fetchdata to fetch data from the api.This function is called when the getuser button in navbar is clicked. I used a external css loader element to show loading while fetching the data.This loading component was used as a component called Loader. I used usestate to change the state of loading element. and i used inside the fetchdata function so that it will change it state according to the fetching of data.
